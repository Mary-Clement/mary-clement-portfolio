## Instructions

1. Open the SVG files in an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
2. Export as JPG at 800x600px resolution
3. Save as `smallchops.jpg` and `realestate.jpg` in this directory
4. Replace the SVG files with the JPG versions

The SVG placeholders are temporary and will display, but JPG format is recommended for better performance and compatibility.
